Feature: Auto-avaliação do aluno
As a Teacher
I want to be able to see the evaluation that my students made for themselves
So that I’m able to see their opinion about how well they are in the goals


Scenario: Auto-avaliação bem-sucedida
Given I’m at the “Main” page
And I see the row for “Auto-avaliação” with no grades from the subject that has “Paulo Borba” as a teacher
When I add the “MPA” as a grade for “Yuri Valença” in “Conceitos de requisitos”, “MA” for “Especificar requisitos” and “MPA” for “Gerência de configuração”
Then A message with “Auto-avaliação bem-sucedida, obrigado!” pops up
And I can no longer add or edit any grade in none of the “metas”
